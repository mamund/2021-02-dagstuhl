== Presentation Outline : Overview
 * Steve Austin & Peter Norvig
 * Turing's Imitation Game
 * About Agents
 * Engineering AMEE
 * Summary

== Steve Austin & Peter Norvig
 * *Steve Austin*
 ** "We can rebuild him. We have the technology. We can make him better than he was. Better...stronger...faster." -- The Six Million Dollar Man, 1973
 ** The technology of the day
 ** The power of a machine
 ** The brain of a human

 * *Peter Norvig*
 ** "More data beats clever algorithms, but better data beats more data." -- Peter Norvig
 ** "How to Write a Spell Corrector" -- Peter Norvig (2007) : http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html
 ** "Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach" -- Russell & Norvig (1994)

== Turing's Imitation Game
 * *Alan Turing*
 ** "Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?" -- Alan Turing, 1950

== About Agents
 * *Intelligent Agent*
 ** "Anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators" -- Russell & Norvig,  "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" (1994)
 * *Autonomous Agents*
 ** "Software entities that carry out operations on behalf of a user with independence and employ  knowledge of the user's goals." -- a multiply cited statement in an IBM white paper no longer accessible
 * *PAGE*
 ** Percepts, Actions, Goals, Environment
 ** Percepts : _Something that is perceived._
 ** Actions : _Something that is done; an act._
 ** Goals : _A desired result._
 ** Environment : _Conditions under which you operate._
 * *Classes of Agents*
 ** Simple reflex agent : door robot
 ** Model-based agent : vacuum robot
 ** Goal-based agent : find this vacuum robot for me online
 ** Utility agent : buy this vacuum robot at the 'best price'
 ** Learning agent : remember where you get the 'best price' on vacuum robots
 * *Intelligent Autonomous Agents*
 ** Imitating users
 ** Carrying out tasks
 ** Using percepts, actions, goals, and environment
 ** Via reflex, model, goal, utility, learning

== Engineering AMEE
AMEE : The Autonomous Maze Environment Explorer

 * *AMEE : What is it?*
 ** AMEE can successfully navigate any 2-dimensional maze of arbitrary size.
 ** Agent Class: Goal-based
 ** Percepts: Various kinds of doors
 ** Actions: Affordances to view, turn, and move
 ** Goals: Escape!
 ** Environment: XML messages via HTTP protocol
 * *AMEE : How do we build it?* : https://github.com/mamund/2021-02-dagstuhl/blob/master/alps/asd/maze-alps.svg
 * *AMEE's algorithm (Model)* : https://github.com/mamund/2021-02-dagstuhl/blob/master/images/2021-02-13-maze-bot-model.png
 * *Coding AMEE (Sensors & Actuators)* : https://github.com/mamund/rwa/blob/master/Maze/the-bot/the-bot.js

== Summary 
 * *The Future of AMEE*
 ** AMEE's Environment :  Include rewards (added points) and dangers (lost points)
 ** Agent Class : Level up to utility[L4] (scoring) and learning[L5] (improving score)
 * *Imitating AMEE in the real world*
 ** Navigation
 ** Selection
 ** Acquiring
 ** Remembering
 ** Learning

== One more thing...
 * *Rene Descartes*
 ** "It is impossible for a machine to have enough different organs to make it act in all the contingencies of life in the way in which our reason makes us act." -- Rene Descartes, Discourse on Method (1637)
 * *We need lots of AMEEs!*

== Thank you!
 * "We can built it, we have the technology…"
 * "Imaginable digital computers…"
 * PAGE & Agent Classes
 * Engineering AMEE
 * "Enough different AMEEs …"
